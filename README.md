# ec-open-data
This repository contains some graphs and statistics that are derived from the 
[open data of the European Commission](http://open-data.europa.eu/data/).

The [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/) already publishes lots of
information and statistics on their open data website, but quite a lot is stored in PDF files
which makes (automated) reuse not so easy. This repository contains some basic
statistics in easily reusable formats like [TSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values)
and [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) with visualisations in a mix
of [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and
[SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).

At the moment it's only based on open data of the [Directorate General for
Education and Culture (DG EAC)](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/index_en.htm)
